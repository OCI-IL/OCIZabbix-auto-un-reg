This open source function allowing IT admins to use Zabbix monitoring with autoscale group, without the need to remove them manually from Zabbix.

Basic Steps to use:(WIP)

1. Update the code with: Zabbix Host name , Zabbix UserName ,Zabbix Password
2. Install the function in OCI(follow the quick start steps and replace without creating then new function)
3. Connect the event termination BEGIN event to the function using the event service.

Work still in progress.
